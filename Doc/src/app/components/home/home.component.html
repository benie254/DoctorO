                <p class="line-half letter-half">Even with clear and obvious physical, psychological, and social effects of drugs & substance use, most addicts are unable to stop using drugs & substances by their own free will. Addiction is this inability to stop, even with all the above stated effects.</p>
                <p class="line-half letter-half">The physical, psychological, and social effects of short to prolonged drug use can be significant. In most cases, drugs can predispose individuals to mental illnesses, lead to organ damage and failure, and in extreme cases, death.</p>
                <p class="line-half letter-half">There is a solution. For most people with substance use disorders, the effects are reversible from the moment of abstinence. But most addicts find it impossible to stop on their own. That is why addicts need help and support.</p>
